I alone shall be the one to feel\nThe cutting of the thread of life.\n\nAnd when the heralds of the Deadly King have gripped me,\nWhat help to me will be my friends and kin?\nFor then life’s virtue is my one defense,\nAnd this, alas, is what I shrugged away.\n\nO protectors! I, so little heeding,\nHardly guessed at horror such as this—\nAnd all for this brief, transient existence,\nI have done so many evil things.\n\nThe day they take him to the scaffold,\nWhere they will tear off his limbs,\nA man is changed, transfigured by his fear:\nHis mouth is dry, his eyes start from his brow.\n\nNo need to say how stricken I shall be\nWhen overcome and sick with dreadful fear,\nI’m seized by forms so horrible to see,\nThe frightful servants of the Lord of Death.\n\nWho can give me safe protection\nFrom this horror, from this frightful dread?\nAnd then I’ll search the four directions,\nSeeking help, with panic-stricken eyes.\n\nBut in those four directions no protection shall I find.\nAnd I shall sink into despairing woe.\nNo refuge will there be for me;\nAt such a time, what shall I do?\n\nThus, from this day forward I take refuge\nIn the Buddhas, guardians of beings,\nWho labor to protect all wanderers,\nThose mighty ones who scatter every fear.\n\nAnd in the Dharma they have realized in their hearts,\nWhich drives away the terrors of saṃsāra,\nAnd in all the host of Bodhisattvas\nLikewise I will perfectly take refuge.\n\nGripped by dread, beside myself with anguish,\nTo Samantabhadra I will give myself;\nMy body I myself will give\nTo Mañjughoṣha, gentle and melodious.\n\nTo him whose deeds of mercy never fail,\nMy lord Avalokita,\nI cry out from depths of misery,\n“Protect me now an evildoer!”\n\nNow to the noble one, Ākāshagarbha,\nAnd to Kṣhitigarbha, from my heart I call.\nTo all protectors, great, compassionate,\nI cry to them in search of refuge.\n\nTo Vajrapaṇi I shall fly,\nFor at the sight of him\nAll vengeful things like Yama’s host\nEscape in terror to the four directions.\n\nFormerly your words I have transgressed,\nBut having seen these terrors all around,\nI come to you for refuge praying:\nSwiftly drive away my fear!\n\nFor if, alarmed by common ailments,\nI must implement the doctor’s words,\nWhat need to speak of when I’m constantly brought low\nBy ills like lust and faults a hundredfold?\n\nAnd if, by one of these alone,\nThe dwellers in the world are all thrown down,\nAnd if no other remedy exists,\nNo other healing elsewhere to be found\n\nThan words of the all-knowing doctor,\nWhich uproot our every ill,\nThe thought to turn on him deaf ears\nIs abject and contemptible stupidity.\n\nAlong a small and ordinary cliff\nIf I must pick my way with special care,\nWhat need to speak of that long-lasting chasm\nPlunging to the depths a thousand leagues?\n\n“Today, at least, I shall not die.”\nSo rash to lull myself with words like these!\nMy dissolution and my hour of death\nWill come to me, of this there is no doubt.\n\nWho can give me fearlessness,\nWhat sure escape is there from this?\nIt’s certain that I’m going to die,\nSo how can I relax, my mind at ease?\n\nOf life’s experience, all seasons past,\nWhat’s left to me, what now remains?\nBy clinging to what now is here no more,\nMy teacher’s precepts I have disobeyed.\n\nAnd when this life is left behind,\nAnd with it all my kith and kin,\nI must set out on strange paths all alone:\nWhy make so much of all my friends and foes?\n\nHow instead can I make sure\nTo rid myself of evil, only cause of sorrow?\nThis should be my one concern,\nMy only thought both night and day.\n\nThe wrongs that I have done\nThrough ignorant stupidity:\nAll actions evil by their nature\nAnd transgressions of the precepts,\n\nFearing all the pains to come\nI join my palms and ceaselessly prostrate,\nAnd everything I will confess\nDirectly in the sight of my protectors.\n\nI pray you, guides and guardians of the world,\nTo take me as I am, a sinful man.\nAnd all these actions, evil as they are,\nI promise I will never do again.",

It begins with 'The making of offerings' (vv.1-23), detailing material, mental, aspirational, and praise offerings to accumulate merit and cultivate generosity. This is followed by 'An act of veneration' (vv.24-25) through prostrations to the Three Jewels and other sacred supports, fostering humility. 'Taking refuge' (v.26) establishes the formal Mahayana commitment. The chapter culminates in an extensive exposition of 'The confession of negative actions' (vv.27-65), guiding the practitioner through the four strengths: regret, reliance on support, remedial action, and resolution, to purify past wrongs and commit to future virtue.",
