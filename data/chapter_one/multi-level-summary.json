The main body (1.2, verses 4-36) then focuses on 'The Generation of Bodhichitta Where It Has Not Previously Existed.' This involves understanding the 'basis required' (1.2.1, vv. 4-5)—the precious human life and rare virtuous thoughts—followed by an extensive exploration of 'the benefits of bodhichitta' (1.2.2, vv. 6-30), detailing its general supremacy, transformative power (illustrated by analogies), specific advantages of intention versus action Bodhichitta, and proofs from scripture and reason. The chapter concludes by extolling 'the greatness of a person who possesses bodhichitta' (1.2.3, vv. 31-36), inspiring reverence for Bodhisattvas.",
