          "content_summary": "This section distinguishes between the two types of relative Bodhicitta: Aspiration Bodhicitta and Engagement Bodhicitta. It explains that Bodhicitta, in brief, comprises these two aspects. An analogy is given: just as there's a difference between wishing to go somewhere and actually embarking on the journey, so too should the wise understand the distinct stages of Aspiration and Engagement. While Aspiration Bodhicitta yields great fruit within cyclic existence, it doesn't produce a continuous stream of merit like Engagement Bodhicitta. Engagement Bodhicitta, taken with an irreversible resolve to liberate all beings, generates an unceasing flow of vast merit, even during sleep or distraction. This is supported by scripture (the Sutra Requested by Subahu). The immense merit of even intending to alleviate minor suffering for a few beings is highlighted; how much greater then is the merit of wishing to dispel all the immeasurable unhappiness of every single being and establish them in boundless good qualities? Such a beneficial intention is unparalleled, not found even in parents, gods, or sages for their own sake, let alone for others. This precious, unprecedented thought of benefiting all beings is a marvel. The merit of this jewel-like mind, the source of all joy and the cure for all suffering, is immeasurable. Even the mere thought of benefiting beings surpasses offerings to Buddhas; how much more so the effort to actually bring about their welfare? The section concludes by noting beings' paradoxical pursuit of suffering despite wishing for happiness, and praises Bodhicitta as the peerless means to fulfill all beings' needs for happiness and cessation of suffering.",

Verses 22-26 then argue through reasoning: if merely thinking to alleviate a minor ailment for a few beings generates immeasurable merit, how much more so the wish to dispel all the immeasurable suffering of every single being and establish them in boundless good qualities? Such an altruistic thought (Bodhicitta) is unparalleled—not found even in parents for their children, nor in gods or sages for their own benefit, let alone for others. This precious, unprecedented thought of benefiting all beings is a marvel, a jewel of the mind, whose merit is as vast as space. Verse 27 further argues that if merely thinking to benefit beings surpasses offerings to Buddhas, how much more so the actual effort (Engagement Bodhicitta) to bring about their welfare? Verses 28-29 reflect on the paradox that beings, though desiring happiness and wishing to avoid suffering, run towards suffering and destroy their own happiness out of delusion. Bodhicitta, which aims to satisfy all beings with all joys, cut off all their suffering, and dispel their delusion, is thus a peerless source of virtue, an unparalleled friend, and an unmatched field of merit.",

(27) How can one measure the merit of this jewel-like mind, which is the cause of joy for all transmigrators and the medicine for the suffering of beings?
