The core of the chapter extols the virtues of Bodhicitta, presenting it as the ultimate panacea for suffering, a force that transforms an ordinary being into a sublime object of veneration, and the most powerful method for purifying negativity and accumulating merit. The chapter distinguishes between the Bodhicitta of aspiration (the wish to attain enlightenment) and the Bodhicitta of engagement (actively practicing the path), using vivid analogies to illustrate their respective power and encouraging the reader to wholeheartedly embrace this precious mind.",

It is divided into two types: the 'Bodhicitta of Aspiration' (the wish to go to enlightenment) and the 'Bodhicitta of Engagement' (the actual journey or practice). An analogy is given: it is like the difference between wanting to go somewhere and actually traveling. While aspiration Bodhicitta yields immense merit in samsara, it is not continuous like the merit of engagement Bodhicitta, which flows unceasingly even while one is asleep or distracted, once the vow has been taken. This claim is substantiated by scripture and further proven by reasoning, which extols the peerless altruistic intention of Bodhicitta as something even gods or sages do not possess, making it a truly wondrous and precious jewel of the mind.",

Two primary supports for developing mindfulness are given: 1) Relying on a spiritual master, whose instructions and the fear of displeasing them naturally lead to mindfulness. 2) Constantly recollecting that one is always in the presence of the omniscient Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. This engenders a sense of shame, respect, and fear of wrongdoing, which in turn gives rise to mindfulness.

Once this foundation of renunciation is established, the chapter presents the core meditative practices: cultivating the equality of self and others (བདག་གཞན་མཉམ་པ།) and, most profoundly, exchanging self for others (བདག་གཞན་བརྗེ་བ།). The chapter culminates in instructions for disciplining the mind, treating the self-cherishing attitude as the ultimate enemy, and dedicating the body and mind entirely to the welfare of all beings.

The second, more profound practice is exchanging self for others (བདག་གཞན་བརྗེ་བ།). This involves actively taking on others' suffering and giving them one's own happiness, viewing the self-cherishing mind as the ultimate enemy and training the mind to rejoice in the welfare of others as if it were one's own. The section concludes with forceful instructions on how to discipline this self-cherishing mind, treating it like an enemy to be conquered for the sake of all beings.",

This practice should not be shirked due to difficulty, as even hearing the name of something frightening can become a source of comfort through habituation.

Aspiring to be high for oneself leads to low rebirths; aspiring for others to be high leads to honor. Using others for one's own sake leads to servitude; using oneself for others' sake leads to lordship. The passage culminates in the famous verses (132-133): all the happiness in the world comes from wishing others to be happy, and all the suffering in the world comes from wishing oneself to be happy. It urges the reader to see this difference between the way of the childish (self-interest) and the Buddhas (other-interest).

Therefore, there is no reason to fear emptiness; it is the very thing that pacifies the suffering caused by grasping at real entities.

The argument proceeds by showing the absurd consequences of this view. If consciousness is permanent, it should perceive its object (e.g., sound) at all times. If it can exist without an object, then even inanimate objects like wood could be called 'conscious'. If a single, permanent consciousness perceives different objects like sound and form sequentially, it must be changing and therefore impermanent. The idea that it's one entity appearing in different 'modes' is also refuted, as this would either imply the self is not unitary or that the modes are illusory, which undermines the Sāṃkhya position.

It then moves to mindfulness of feelings, analyzing their nature, causes, and results to show they are not solid entities. Next, it applies mindfulness to the mind itself, demonstrating that consciousness cannot be located and has no independent arising. Finally, it addresses mindfulness of phenomena (`dharma`) in general, concluding that all things are unarisen.

It analyzes the cause of feelings—the contact (`sparśa`) between sense faculty and object—and shows it to be logically impossible due to the paradoxes of partless atoms either touching or not touching. Since the cause (contact) is unfindable, the result (feeling) must also be baseless.

The objection that a stronger feeling merely suppresses a weaker one is refuted by stating that what is not being experienced cannot be called a 'feeling'. The conclusion is that feelings are not inherent in objects or in the mind, but are mental imputations arising from specific conditions.
