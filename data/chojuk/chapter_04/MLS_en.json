The chapter systematically builds a case for diligent effort by first exploring the grave consequences of neglecting one's vows, then contemplating the precious, impermanent, and rare nature of the human life that makes practice possible, and finally identifying the internal afflictions (ཉོན་མོངས) as the true enemy to be overcome through unwavering resolve and wisdom.",
