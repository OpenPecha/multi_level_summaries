The commentary then presents a deep philosophical argument: the distinction between 'my suffering' and 'your suffering' is based on a false sense of a solid, independent self. Since the 'self' that experiences suffering in the future is technically a different entity from the present self, the logic for caring for our future self is the same as for caring for another person.

It deconstructs the concepts of 'continuity' (rgyud) and 'collection' (tshogs) as mere conventional labels, not real entities. The second objection is: if there is no self, who is there to remove suffering? The text refutes this by pointing out the contradiction: if you argue for removing your own suffering, you must, by the same logic, argue for removing everyone's. The final objection is: why voluntarily take on the suffering of compassion? The answer is that the minor suffering of compassion prevents the immense suffering of countless beings, making it a worthy and logical choice, as exemplified by the Bodhisattva Metok Dzeshe.",

Building on this foundation, it then teaches the more profound practice of 'Exchanging Self and Other' (vv. 111-184). This is explained by first detailing the immense benefits of cherishing others versus the faults of self-cherishing, then providing specific techniques to overcome pride and jealousy through empathetic reversal, and finally offering a comprehensive guide on how to live a life completely dedicated to the welfare of others after having made this exchange.",

Uniquely, these are not merely for achieving tranquility, but are powerful techniques for cultivating relative Bodhicitta: first, the meditation on the 'Equality of Self and Other', and second, the more advanced practice of 'Exchanging Self and Other'.
