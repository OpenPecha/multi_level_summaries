        "content_summary": "Chapter 7, \"Diligence\" (བརྩོན་འགྲུས།), provides a comprehensive guide to cultivating the joyful effort essential for the Bodhisattva path. It begins by establishing diligence as the foundation for all merit and enlightenment. The chapter then systematically deconstructs the primary obstacle to diligence—laziness (ལེ་ལོ།)—by analyzing its three forms: indolence, attachment to negative actions, and self-discouragement. For each form, it presents powerful contemplative antidotes centered on impermanence, the preciousness of human life, and the innate potential for Buddhahood. Finally, it outlines a constructive framework for actively developing diligence through the \"Four Forces\" (དཔུང་བཞི།: Aspiration, Steadfastness, Joy, and Letting Go) and the \"Two Powers\" (སྟོབས་གཉིས།: Conscientiousness and Control), equipping the practitioner with a complete toolkit for transforming apathy into vigorous, joyful, and effective spiritual practice.",

The text emphasizes the suddenness of death, which can strike at any time, leaving our tasks unfinished and filling us with regret. It graphically describes the terror of the death process and the subsequent suffering of the lower realms. The section concludes with the urgent plea to use this precious human life—this 'boat'—to cross the ocean of suffering before it is lost forever.",

Second is the Force of Steadfastness (བརྟན་པ།), which involves cultivating three types of constructive pride: in one's actions, capabilities, and ability to conquer afflictions. Third is the Force of Joy (དགའ་བ།), which is the practice of finding satisfaction in virtuous deeds themselves, not just their results. Fourth is the Force of Letting Go (དོར་བ།), which is the wisdom of knowing when to rest to avoid burnout and when to move on from a completed task to the next, more challenging one.",

A single moment of inattention allows the 'poison' of negativity to pervade the mind. Therefore, one must be as careful as someone carrying a full bowl of oil while threatened by a swordsman.
