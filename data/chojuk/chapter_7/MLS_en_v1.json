The text cites the Buddha's words that even insects like flies and bees can achieve enlightenment if they apply themselves, so a human being, who has the capacity to distinguish benefit from harm, surely can. It counters the fear of the path's hardships (like giving one's body) by pointing out that we have already endured immense, pointless suffering in countless past lives. The suffering on the path, by contrast, is purposeful, limited, and leads to the cessation of all suffering, like a patient enduring a minor, painful surgery to cure a major disease. Ultimately, the bodhisattva path is presented as a joyful journey on the 'chariot of the awakened mind,' which eliminates all weariness.",

It begins by establishing the necessity of diligence as the force that activates all merit, following logically from the perfection of patience. The chapter is then structured into a detailed methodology: it first defines diligence as 'joy in virtue,' then addresses the abandonment of its opposites—the three types of laziness (indolence, attachment to negative actions, and discouragement)—by providing specific antidotes for each. Finally, it outlines the constructive path to building diligence through the cultivation of the 'Four Forces' (Aspiration, Steadfastness, Joy, and Letting Go) and the 'Two Powers' (Conscientiousness and Control). The chapter provides a complete psychological framework for transforming laziness into a powerful, sustainable, and joyful energy for the bodhisattva path.",
