        "content_summary": "This chapter, the culmination of the Bodhicaryāvatāra, focuses on the perfection of wisdom (Prajñāpāramitā), the direct antidote to the ignorance that perpetuates suffering. It begins by establishing that all other perfections, like generosity and patience, are cultivated for the sake of wisdom. The chapter systematically presents the doctrine of the Two Truths (conventional and ultimate) as the framework for understanding reality. It then engages in a rigorous deconstruction of the seemingly solid nature of the self (pudgala-nairātmya) and phenomena (dharma-nairātmya) through logical analysis, refuting opposing philosophical schools. The purpose of this analysis is to guide the practitioner in meditating on emptiness, thereby eradicating the cognitive and emotional obscurations and ultimately realizing the non-conceptual, compassionate state of Buddhahood for the benefit of all beings.",

If a single, permanent consciousness perceives different objects like sound and form sequentially, it must be changing and therefore impermanent.

It analyzes the cause of feelings—the contact (`sparśa`) between sense faculty and object—and shows it to be logically impossible due to the paradoxes of partless atoms either touching or not touching. Since the cause (contact) is unfindable, the result (feeling) must also be baseless.
