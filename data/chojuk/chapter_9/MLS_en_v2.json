It systematically establishes the doctrine of the Two Truths (Conventional and Ultimate), refutes objections from other Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools, and details the meditation on the selflessness of persons and phenomena. The chapter concludes by showing how the realization of emptiness, far from leading to nihilism, is the very foundation for boundless compassion and the effortless activity of a Buddha, ultimately fulfilling the Bodhisattva's vow to liberate all beings.",
