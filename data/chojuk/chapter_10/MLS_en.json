The provided Tibetan commentary was used to enrich the analysis of each node's purpose, key concepts, and pedagogical strategy.

Specifically, 'Hungry Ghosts' was corrected to span 17-18, 'General Sufferings' to 19-48, and 'Dedicating for One's Own Bodhisattva Conduct' to 52-57. The analysis aims to capture not only the explicit prayers but also the underlying psychological and philosophical transformations intended by the structure of the chapter, which moves from alleviating others' suffering to cultivating the self for that purpose, and finally to preserving the Dharma itself.",
