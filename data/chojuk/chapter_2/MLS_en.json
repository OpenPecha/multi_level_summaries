      "content_summary": "This chapter, 'Confession of Negativity,' systematically outlines the preliminary practices required to purify the mind and accumulate merit, thereby creating a suitable vessel for the arising of bodhichitta. It begins with an extensive section on making offerings—material, mental, and aspirational—to cultivate generosity and reverence. This is followed by the physical act of veneration through prostration to overcome pride. The practitioner then formally enters the path by taking refuge in the Three Jewels. The core of the chapter is a profound and detailed exposition of the confession of negative actions, structured around the four powers: regret (powerfully induced by contemplating death), support (relying on the enlightened beings), remedy (applying the Dharma), and resolution (vowing not to repeat the misdeeds).",

The bottom-up approach ensured that parent summaries logically synthesized the content of their children, maintaining conceptual coherence throughout the hierarchy. The Tibetan terms were included as key concepts where appropriate to preserve the specificity of the original philosophical language. The verse_text_excerpt was excluded from the final output as requested."
